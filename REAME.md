#Slides about Salt

There is some slides in french about Salt-stack.
These slides are provided under the WTFPL (What The Fuck Public License).

The materials from Despicable Me and Doctor Who are probably over-copyrighted, so don't use them from my slides (anyway, I got the photos from a famous search engine).

If you want more details about Salt-stack, the WTFPL, Despicable Me or Doctor Who, DuckDuckGo is your friend.
