#Slides about Salt

There is some slides in french about Salt-stack.

You can see the presentation on http://slides.fiat-tux.fr/slides_salt, but I'm pretty sure it will be more clear with speaker's explanations.

These slides are provided under the WTFPL (What The Fuck Public License).

The materials from Despicable Me and Doctor Who are probably over-copyrighted, so don't use them from my slides (anyway, I got the photos from a famous search engine).

If you want more details about Salt-stack, the WTFPL, Despicable Me or Doctor Who, DuckDuckGo is your friend.
